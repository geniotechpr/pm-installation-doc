Click on your operating system below to reveal the installation steps to follow. 
<details><summary>Windows (WSL2)</summary>
<p>

1. Follow [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) guide for installing a Linux distribution on your Windows machine. This will allow you to operate Windows and Linux at the same time. Given its system requirements, **installation of ProcessMaker 4 will be done in the Linux subsystem**. 
1. The Ubuntu Linux distribution will be installed by default. [Other](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands#install-a-specific-linux-distribution) Linux distributions can also be installed. 
1. Restart your machine after WSL installation process is completed. 
1. Follow the steps for your specific Linux distribution in one of the sections below. 

    <details><summary>WLS2 Ubuntu</summary>
    <p>

    #### Required Software and Services
    1. Download [this](https://github.com/esarrit/pm-installation-doc/blob/main/install-requirements.sh) script. 
    1. Using a File Explorer window, search for this path `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<your-username>` and move the script there. Note that `<your-username>` is the username you specified during the WSL2 Linux installation and this **might** differ from your Windows User depending on your choice. If File Explorer can't find the path, search only for `\\wsl$\` and navigate manually to `home\<your-username>`.    
    1. Open the [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) in your machine and open a window for Ubuntu. 
        - Note that you can also run a Linux distribution from PowerShell or CMD with the `wsl` command. Just make sure you are performing the installation steps on `/mnt/c/Users/<your-username>` (Linux) and **NOT** on `C:\Users\<your-username>` (Windows). 
    1. Confirm that the script you moved to your user home directory is there by executing the `ls` command. Then, run `sudo bash install-requirements.sh`. This will install most of the required software and services needed for ProcessMaker 4. 
    1. Close the current Ubuntu terminal window and open a new one. 
    1. Run the following commands to check if php, composer, and nvm were installed correctly. You should expect the php version to be 8.1.
      ```
      php --version
      composer
      composer --version
      command -v nvm 
      ```
    1. Run `nvm install 16.18.1` to install the expected node version and `npm install -g npm@8.9.0` to install the expected npm version. 

    #### MySQL
    1. Run the set of commands below to uninstall MySQL and MySQL server on WSL2 Ubuntu
        ```
        sudo apt purge mysql-server
        sudo apt purge mysql
        sudo apt purge mysql-client
        sudo apt purge mysql-common mysql-server-core-*
        sudo apt purge mysql-client-core-*
        ```
    1. Confirm there is no MySQL by executing `which mysql` and `mysql --version`. 
    1. Install wget by running `sudo apt install wget -y` and then execute the commands below
    1. Run `wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.12-1_all.deb` and `sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.12-1_all.deb`. Choose Ubuntu Bionic and click OK, select MySQL 5.7 server and click OK.
    1. Run `sudo apt-get update`. 
        - If you encounter an error similar to "signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 467B942D3A79BD29", execute the following commands:
        ```
        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 467B942D3A79BD29
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt-cache policy mysql-server
        sudo apt install -f mysql-community-client=5.7*
        sudo apt install -f mysql-client=5.7* mysql-community-server=5.7* mysql-server=5.7*
        ```
    1. Run `sudo service mysql start` and sudo `mysql_secure_installation`. Press the Y key to start the installation and set the root password when prompted.
    1. Check the MySQL version using `mysql --version`. It should be version 5.7.
    1. Login to MySQL running `mysql -u root -p` and entering the root password previously set. 
    1. Create the ProcessMaker database with the `create database processmaker;` command. Then, confirm the database is available running `show databases;`. You should see processmaker in the list of databases. Use `exit;` command to terminate MySQL. 

    #### Docker
    1. Download and install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). 
    1. Open the Docker Desktop application and go to Settings > Resources > WSL INTEGRATION. 
    1. Turn on Ubuntu. Click on Apply & Restart. 
    1. Reopen the Docker Desktop app, navigate to WSL INTEGRATION, and ensure your screen looks like the image below.

        ![Screenshot (17)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47648788/203155035-9e5fcc4d-62c5-4c59-9985-eb51f65acdd6.png)
    1. Restart your computer. 

    #### Install ProcessMaker
    1. Open a Ubuntu terminal window.
    1. In the home directory, clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/ProcessMaker/processmaker.git ~/src/processmaker`. 
    1. Download the [start-services](https://github.com/esarrit/pm-installation-doc/blob/main/start-services.sh),[status-services](https://github.com/esarrit/pm-installation-doc/blob/main/status-services.sh), and [stop-services](https://github.com/esarrit/pm-installation-doc/blob/main/status-services.sh) scripts. Move them to `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<your-username>` like you did at the beginning of this guide with the installation script. 
    1. Start the services by running `sudo bash start-services.sh`. Check the status of the services by running `sudo bash status-services.sh`. In case you would like to stop services at any point to restart them or shut down, run `sudo bash stop-services.sh`. 
    1. Once services are running, move into the processmaker directory `cd ~/src/processmaker`. 
    1. Within the processmaker directory, run the following set of commands: `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs` and `php artisan processmaker:install`. 
        - If you experience an error of `DOMDOCUMENT` not being found, run `sudo apt-get install php8.1-xml`. Then, delete the .env file by executing `sudo rm .env`. Lastly, re-run `php artisan processmaker:install`. 
    1. After this, the ProcessMaker installation process will start. Please be patient, as this may take some time (~ 5-15 minutes). Throughout the install, you will be asked to enter a few configuration parameters. Some guiding principles for entering these parameters:
        - Use suggested values wherever possible. 
        - For MySQL, use `root` as username and the password you configured previously during the MySQL set-up. 
        - The instance URL is not that important. You can input any URL that you would like. To run ProcessMaker locally we will be using another URL later.

    #### Configurations

    ##### Configure the .env File
    1. After the installation process is finished, add the configurations below to your .env file. This file exists within the processmaker directory. You can easily edit directly on the command line by running `sudo vim .env`. If you are unfamiliar with vim or need a refresher, see [this](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/beginners-guide-vim) resource. 
        ```
        # Run laravel echo server with HTTP instead of HTTPS
        LARAVEL_ECHO_SERVER_PROTO=http
        LARAVEL_ECHO_SERVER_SSL_KEY=""
        LARAVEL_ECHO_SERVER_SSL_CERT=""

        # Don't require a valid cert for SDK calls in script tasks
        API_SSL_VERIFY=0

        # Run `which node` to get the path to nodejs
        NODE_BIN_PATH=/path/to/node/v14.4.0/bin/node

        # Run `which docker` to get the path to the docker executable
        PROCESSMAKER_SCRIPTS_DOCKER=/usr/local/bin/docker

        # Allow cookies to be served over HTTP
        SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=false

        # Allow connections from script tasks to connect back to your host
        DOCKER_HOST_URL=http://host.docker.internal

        # Allow connections from script tasks to connect back to your host
        CACHE_DRIVER=redis
        ```
    1. Crosscheck the “.env“ file and ensure no key is repeated within the file. 
    1. Run `which docker` in the Ubuntu terminal window to get the value to set as `PROCESSMAKER_SCRIPTS_DOCKER` in the .env file.
    1. Run `which node` in the Ubuntu terminal window to get the value to set as `NODE_BIN_PATH` in the .env file. 
    1. Save the .env file. 
    1. Clear the cache by running `php artisan optimize:clear`. **This command needs to be performed every time changes are made to the .env file.**

    ##### Configure PHP FPM
    1. Open a new Ubuntu terminal window. 
    1. Change into pool.d directory: `cd  /etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d`. Inside this directory, there will be a www.conf file. Use `sudo vim www.conf` to open it. 
    1. Look for the "listen" value and modify it by appending `9000;` to the start of the line, as shown below. 
    ![Screenshot (21)_LI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47648788/204310557-86b1c8cb-129b-4cf5-b5db-ee2a907c4fd7.jpg)
    1. Save your changes to the www.conf file. 

    ##### Configure NGINX
    1. Run the `pwd` command on your processmaker directory. Store that path in a notepad. 
    1. Navigate to NGINX sites-enabled by running `cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled`. Open the default file by running `sudo vim default`. 
    1. Replace what's inside the file with the configuration below. 
        ```
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name pmdev host.docker.internal;
            root processmaker_project_path/public;

            index index.php index.html index.htm;

            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
            }

            error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
                root   html;
            }

            location ~ \.php$ {
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php =404;
                fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
                fastcgi_index  index.php;
                fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /$realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
                include        fastcgi_params;
                fastcgi_read_timeout 300;
            }
        }
        ```
    1. Within the configuration above, replace `processmaker_project_path` with the processmaker directory path stored on your notepad.
    1. Save your changes to the default file. 

    ##### Configure Windows
    1. Open a Ubuntu terminal window and run `ifconfig`. Store the IP address on a notepad. The IP address is highlighted in the image below.
    ![Screenshot (22)_LI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47648788/204313414-fa395d2d-3cc0-485c-8934-63b3ec944ec7.jpg)
    1. On your Windows system, open File Explorer and go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc. 
    1. Open the hosts file as an Administrator. 
    1. Add the line `ifconfig_value pmdev` to the end of the file. Replace "ifconfig_value" with the IP address value you previously retrieved. 
    1. Save your changes. 

    #### Compile, Configure, and Test the ProcessMaker Project
    1. Open a Ubuntu terminal window and navigate to the processmaker directory. 
    1. Ensure that services are running with `sudo bash status-services.sh`.
    1. Run `npm install --allow-root` and then `npm run dev`. 
    1. Perform `cd ..` to navigate to the src parent directory, and perform the following command: `chown -R www-data:www-data processmaker`. 
    1. On your Windows system, open a browser window and enter `http://pmdev`. You should now see ProcessMaker load and arrive at the login screen. 

    #### Troubleshooting
    If you run into issues after entering the dev URL into your browser, below are some things to note.

    - Double check all services are running by executing `sudo bash status-services.sh`. 
    - Confirm that the correct IP address from `ifconfig` step obtained from your WSL Ubuntu machine matches the one placed in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts. **This can change if your system is restarted.**
    - It is very important for NGINX to have the appropriate permissions as www-data to write to the processmaker directory in order for the web app to work. www-data is the user that web servers on Ubuntu, such as NGINX, use by default for normal operation. 
    - Previously, we used the `chown` command to change the owner of the processmaker directory to be www-data. However, if you still run into issues due to permissions, there are some things you can try to troubleshoot. Use `ls -l` to check current permissions and the [chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod) command to adjust permissions as needed. Again, www-data needs to have write permissions for the processmaker directory and specific files within it.
    - For further troubleshooting, access the NGINX error logs in `/var/log/nginx`.
